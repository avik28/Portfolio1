        <h2>Me</h2>
        <pre class="intro" style="font-size:17px;">
            Hello, I am K. Sai Avinash. I am currently pursuing B.Tech in Hyderabad.
            I took up Computer Science and Engineering, specializing in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.
            I chose this course because I had a knack for coding from a young age.
          
            Always surrounding myself with computers and exploring how they work fascinated me, and I wanted to learn more. 
            So, here I am, coding a website that describes me and my work.
      
            I hope to make this website grow dynamically as I grow. All my achievements, hobbies, 
            and experiences will be included as I progress in my career and personal life.
